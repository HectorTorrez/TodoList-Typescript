My Awesome Project
This week I have been learning about TypeScript and made a project to consolidate my skills.

Link to project: https://todolistty.netlify.app/


How It's Made:
Tech used: React, TypeScript and CSS

I installed the necessary dependencies to work with TypeScript, I create all the necessary components to have clean code and I create all the types for the props and hooks.


Lessons Learned:
I learned it's better to have the types in other folders and the props in the component.
